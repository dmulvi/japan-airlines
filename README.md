This is a Crossmint demo project that you can build using following the quickstart guide:
https://docs.crossmint.com/nft-checkout/embedded/quickstart

Built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

To skip the walkthrough and get this app running immediately you can clone the repo and run locally. If you want to build it step by step (< 10 min), follow the [quickstart guide](https://docs.crossmint.com/nft-checkout/embedded/quickstart) instead.

```bash
# copy the repo to your local machine
git clone git@github.com:Crossmint/crossmint-embedded-demo.git

# change into the directory
cd crossmint-embedded-demo

# install dependencies / yarn or npm obviously work too xD
pnpm install
```

You'll also need to create an `.env.local` file, which you can do by by copying `env.sample` to `.env.local` and adding the values from your Crossmint staging or production collection.

You can also use the `projectId` and `collectionId` values here to test things out right away.

> [!NOTE]  
> The Crossmint `projectId` and `collectionId` values are **not** sensitive and can be exposed.

```shell
NEXT_PUBLIC_CROSSMINT_PROJECT_ID="e56a55e2-d4b1-4701-8709-2af6a73d9bb5"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CROSSMINT_COLLECTION_ID="3b70aac7-5205-4603-a4d4-fa347460d903"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CROSSMINT_ENVIRONMENT="staging"
```

Once you have the environment file setup you can run the app locally to test it out.

```bash
# run the app locally and open in your browser
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
